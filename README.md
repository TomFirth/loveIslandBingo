# Love Island Bingo

## What is this?

I started watching Love Island, the hit ITV fly on the wall game show.

Where good looking people show their insecurities and vulnerabilities to the nation for money.

..or the pursuit of love. (but I don't think anyone really believes them)

A mixture of noticing that the 'contestants', random words being used frequently and boredom, forced me to create this game.

Because why not.
